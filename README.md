# EkoHeartRate

Designed to analyze images of phonocardiogram (PCG) data to detect heartbeats and estimate the beats per minute (BPM). This tool processes images of PCG waveforms, identifies the locations of heartbeats within the image, groups detected beats to account for signal variations, and calculates an estimated BPM based on the detected beats.

It is set up to work with a screenshot of an Eko PCG recording. It assumes a 3 second window is captured in the screenshot.
